ARMV30MZ To do
--------------

	Optimize cycle counting when all opcodes are converted to ARM asm.
	Rename more opcodes.
	Implement Halt (0xf4) correctly.
	Make 26, 2E, 36 & 3E share code?
	ADC & SBC are wrong in C code?
	Poll (0x9b) is used? What pin is this connected to?

	SP can get borked when pushing/poping, should be masked?
		Make it use the top 16bit.
