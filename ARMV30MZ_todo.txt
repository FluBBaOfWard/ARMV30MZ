ARMV30MZ To do
--------------

	Use a register for flags? Or PC?
	CallFar (9A) uses r4-r7.
	Prepare (C8) uses r4-r9.
	Rename more opcodes.
	Make 26, 2E, 36 & 3E share code?
	ADC & SBC are wrong in C code?
	Poll (0x9b) is used? What pin is this connected to?

	SP can get borked when pushing/poping, should be masked?
		Make it use the top 16bit.
