ARMV30MZ To do
--------------

	Make SRegs access different code paths for each reg.
	Make define for combining PC + CS + Rom offset.
	Fix opcode 37 & 3F? Carry should always be same as Aux?
	Make ModRM use 32bit instead of bytes to optimize EA access.
	Prepare (C8) uses r4-r8, (r8 = SP).
	Interrupt uses r4-r6, (r6 = SP).
	Interrupt #6 is invalid opcode?
	Hard to use a dedicated register for v30Regs since they can be accessed by index.
	Rename more opcodes.
	Make 26, 2E, 36 & 3E share code?
	Poll (0x9b) is used? What pin is this connected to?
