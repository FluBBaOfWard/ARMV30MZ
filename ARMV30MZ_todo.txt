ARMV30MZ To do
--------------

	Figure out how Zero flag is set during division exception.
	Make all rep instructions able to recognize interrupts.
	Segment wrapping eats extra cycles? At least for LDS.
	Log opcode for undefined instructions.
	Prepare (C8) uses r4-r8, (r8 = SP).
	Interrupt uses r4-r6, (r6 = SP).
	Rename more opcodes.

	Buslock is used with REP and hinders interrupts until finished.
	* Break in REPE/REPNE (0xF2/0xF3) to see if any games use BUSLOCK.
	Make 26, 2E, 36 & 3E share code?
	Try to figure out how emulation mode works, if it works at all.
