ARMV30MZ To do
--------------

	Add support for TRAP/BRK exception (int 1, prio 4).
	Make all rep instructions able to recognize interrupts.
	Add fetchforce for ops setting SS (POP SS, MOV SREGW).
	Segment wrapping eats extra cycles? At least for LDS.
	Log opcode for undefined instructions.
	Make SRegs access different code paths for each reg.
	Prepare (C8) uses r4-r8, (r8 = SP).
	Interrupt uses r4-r6, (r6 = SP).
	Rename more opcodes.

	Buslock is used with REP and hinders interrupts until finished.
	* Break in REPE/REPNE (0xF2/0xF3) to see if any games use BUSLOCK.
	Make 26, 2E, 36 & 3E share code?
