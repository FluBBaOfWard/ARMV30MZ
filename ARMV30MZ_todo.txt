ARMV30MZ To do
--------------

	Make all regs use the top 16bit.
	Make ModRM use 32bit instead of bytes to optimize EA access.
	Use a register for flags?
	Prepare (C8) uses r4-r8, (r8 = SP).
	Interrupt uses r4-r7, (r7 = SP).
	Hard to use a dedicated register for v30Regs since they can be accessed by index.
	Add check of IRQ efter EI and RETI.
	Rename more opcodes.
	Make 26, 2E, 36 & 3E share code?
	ADC & SBC are wrong in C code?
	Poll (0x9b) is used? What pin is this connected to?
