ARMV30MZ To do
--------------

	Use a register for PC.
	Use a register for flags?
	Prepare (C8) uses r4-r8, (r8 = SP).
	Interrupt uses r4-r7, (r7 = SP).
	Add check of IRQ efter EI and RETI.
	Rename more opcodes.
	Make 26, 2E, 36 & 3E share code?
	ADC & SBC are wrong in C code?
	Poll (0x9b) is used? What pin is this connected to?

	SP can get borked when pushing/poping, should be masked?
		Make it use the top 16bit.
