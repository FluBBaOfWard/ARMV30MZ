ARMV30MZ To do
--------------

	Log opcode for undefined instructions.
	Make SRegs access different code paths for each reg.
	Make ModRM use 32bit instead of bytes to optimize EA access.
	Prepare (C8) uses r4-r8, (r8 = SP).
	Interrupt uses r4-r6, (r6 = SP).
	Hard to use a dedicated register for v30Regs since they can be accessed by index.
	Make define for combining PC + CS + Rom offset.
	Rename more opcodes.

	Buslock is used with REP and hinders interrupts until finished.
	Make 26, 2E, 36 & 3E share code?

	Get rid of "bx lr" in all opcodes!
	* i_popf needs to be able to be called from IRET.
	* All SEG_PREFIX opcodes need its own jumptable?
	* REPNE/REPE prefix opcodes need their own jumptable.
		Rewrite all opcodes that can be repeating.
		opcodes used with REP:
		 i_inmb, i_inmw, i_outmb, i_outmw, i_movsb, i_movsw, i_cmpsb, i_cmpsw,
		 i_stosb, i_stosw, i_lodsb, i_lodsw, i_scasb, i_scasw.
